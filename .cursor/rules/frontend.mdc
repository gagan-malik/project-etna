# Frontend

When editing UI (components, app pages), follow these conventions.

## Components

- Use existing components from components/ui/ (Shadcn); add new ones via Shadcn MCP (.cursor/mcp.json).
- Prefer composition over prop drilling; use context sparingly.
- Colocate component-specific logic; keep components small and reusable.

## Consistency

- Match patterns from docs/product/UX_MASTER_FILE.md (toasts, modals, command palette, responsive breakpoints).
- Use design tokens / Tailwind; avoid one-off colors or spacing that bypass the design system.

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML and proper labels (Label + Input with htmlFor/id or aria-label for icon-only).
- Ensure keyboard focus and visible focus states; Esc closes modals; no keyboard traps.
- For new forms or interactive UI, apply the **accessibility** skill (`.cursor/skills/accessibility/SKILL.md`).

## UX

- For flows, layouts, or forms, also apply [.cursor/rules/ux-usability-accessibility.mdc](.cursor/rules/ux-usability-accessibility.mdc) and the **ux-review** / **usability-check** skills when relevant.
