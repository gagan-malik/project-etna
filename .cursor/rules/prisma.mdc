# Prisma

## Schema
- Keep schema.prisma the single source of truth; avoid raw SQL for schema changes.
- Use meaningful model and field names; add @@map if DB naming differs.

## Migrations
- Create migrations via `prisma migrate dev` for local changes; use `prisma migrate deploy` in CI/production.
- Do not edit migration files by hand after they have been applied; add a new migration for fixes.

## Access
- Use Prisma client from lib/prisma.ts; no raw SQL unless necessary (e.g. complex queries), and prefer parameterized/Prisma APIs.
