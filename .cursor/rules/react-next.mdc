# React & Next.js Patterns

## Components
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (hooks/ or colocated).
- Colocate component-specific styles and types when they are not shared.

## Server vs client
- Prefer Server Components (default); no "use client" unless needed.
- Use "use client" only for: useState/useEffect, event handlers that must run in browser, or libraries that require client (e.g. some Radix usage is already in client components).

## UI
- Use existing components from components/ui/ (Shadcn); add new ones via Shadcn MCP.
- Prefer composition over prop drilling; use context sparingly.
